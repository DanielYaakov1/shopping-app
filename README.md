Overview
This is a shopping app built using a monorepo structure and the React and Node.js frameworks. The app allows users to browse and purchase items, with features such as a shopping cart and checkout process.

Monorepo Structure
The project is organized using a monorepo structure, where all of the code for the frontend and backend is stored in a single repository. This allows for easier code sharing and collaboration across different parts of the app.

Frameworks
The frontend of the app is built using the React framework, which allows for building complex user interfaces using a component-based approach. The backend of the app is built using the Node.js framework, which allows for building fast and scalable server-side applications.

Setup
To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (the Node.js package manager) installed on your machine..

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/shopping-app.git
Install the dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm start
The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/
