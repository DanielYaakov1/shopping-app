🛍️ Overview 🛍️🛍️

shopping app is a user-friendly platform that enables customers to browse and purchase items easily. It comes with useful features such as a shopping cart and checkout process, making it a convenient shopping experience for all users.

💻 Technology Stack 💻

shopping app project is built using a monorepo architecture, with both the frontend and backend housed in the same repository. For the frontend, we used React - a popular JavaScript framework for building user interfaces. The backend was built using Node.js, a powerful server-side JavaScript environment. We chose these technologies because of their ability to create fast, responsive, and scalable applications.

🚀 Frameworks 🚀

We have used React and Node.js frameworks to build our shopping app. React is an efficient JavaScript library that allows for building complex user interfaces using a component-based approach. On the other hand, Node.js is a powerful server-side JavaScript environment that allows for building fast and scalable applications.

🔑 Authentication 🔑

We understand how important security is when it comes to online shopping. That's why we implemented robust authentication methods in our app. Users can log in using their Google, Facebook, or Apple accounts, all thanks to Firebase authentication. Firebase is a powerful tool that allowed us to easily integrate these authentication methods with our app.

🔧 Setup 🔧

To run the app locally, you will need to have Node.js and npm (Node.js package manager) installed on your machine. Here are the steps to get started:

Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/<username>/shopping-app.git
Install the dependencies: npm install
Start the development server: npm start
The app should now be running on http://localhost:3000/. You can make changes to the code and see the changes reflected in the app in real-time.
